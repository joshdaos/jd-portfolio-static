            <p>
                Hello, my name is Josh Daos.<br></br>
                I am a Software Engineer that is based in the Bay Area.<br></br>
                I always had a knack for tech, but never imagined to work in tech until a year ago. <br></br>
                I was exposed to programming in late 2019, where a relative showed me a project. <br></br>
                I became intrigued from how he was able to create and develop something. <br></br>
                My hunger to know more about this space was birthed.
